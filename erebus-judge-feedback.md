# Erebus Judge Feedback

## Summary

## Functionality

## Presentation

## Thoroughness
Unfortunately the candidate falls a bit short in thoroughness. API errors aren't handled: It just asks you if a blank picture is the villain (with no error state). You can definitely upload things that aren't images, and similar a "No Match" isn't handled properly.

- Lack of file type validation
- Does not handle basic errors like XHR failures in the UI
